# Dice-Roller
This script is a Graphical Dice Roller implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The application provides an interactive experience for rolling custom dice with unique numbered sides. Users can choose the number of dice (1 to 3) to roll, view the sides assigned to each die, and see the results.
