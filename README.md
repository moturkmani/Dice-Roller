# Graphical Dice Roller

This is an interactive dice roller application built with Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to roll dice with unique numbered sides and view the results in a visually appealing GUI.

## Features
- **Customizable Dice Rolls**: Choose between 1 to 3 dice to roll.
- **Unique Sides**: Each die has 12 unique sides numbered from 1 to 25.
- **Rolling Animation**: Simulates the dice rolling process visually (needs improvement).
- **Result Display**: Shows individual dice rolls and the total value.
- **Restart or Quit**: Easily restart the application or exit after rolling.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python Installation**:
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, check the box to "Add Python to PATH."
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     python --version
     pip --version
     ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - This script uses Python's built-in `tkinter` library, so no additional installations are needed.

## How to Use
1. **Download or Clone the Script**:
   Save the `dice_roller.py` file to your desired directory.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python dice_roller.py
     ```

3. **Interact with the Application**:
   - A GUI window will open, welcoming you to the Dice Roller.
   - Choose how many dice to roll (1 to 3).
   - View the unique sides assigned to each die.
   - Click "Roll Dice" to see the rolling animation and results.
   - After rolling, you can restart or quit the application.

## Notes
- This script uses the Tkinter library for GUI interactions; ensure your Python installation supports it.
- For best results, use a system with a screen resolution that supports the application's default window size (800x600).

## Example Use Case
Use this script as a fun and interactive way to simulate dice rolls for games or educational purposes. It can be extended to support different dice configurations or integrated into larger projects.
